## üîç Key Metrics Explained

* **Transactions:** Represents the total number of property sales or ownership transfers recorded within a specific location. Higher transaction counts indicate greater market activity and liquidity.
* **Median Price:** The middle value of all property prices within a given category (e.g., a specific township or property type). This robust measure helps to provide a 'typical' price, minimizing the impact of unusually high or low sales.
